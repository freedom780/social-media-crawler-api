            <p>The Matrix is a very interesting movie</p>
            <p>It tells a great story about people living in the matrix controlled by AI.</p>
            <p>The main characters are Neo and Trinity. They periodically get into the mAtrix to fight agents.</p>
            <p>So far, there have been 3 matches of the word MATRIX. Oops! Now, it's four and it was in upper case!</p>
            <p>What if the 5th entry is surrounded with punctuation like this:matrix, what else? </p>
        </div>

        <matrix>
            Let's make sure that the HTML tags don't count. We are not counting the two enclosing tags for this text
        </matrix>

        <div matrix="matrix">
            Attributes don't count either. Still five matches at this point.
